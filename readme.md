Shattered Lands
===============

The planet you landed on has deep chasms and is full of rocks and cliffs. Traveling and moving resources will be a challenge. Good thing that you have some technologies to help you.

Gameplay
---------

This mod changes map generation to make the map more difficult to navigate. It generates abyss tiles and adds more environmental hazards. It also adds some modes of transportation, namely a grappling hook and spidertron logistics.

When starting a new game, select the Shattered Lands preset!

The map generation creates deep chasms with narrow bridges in between them. Some bridges are crumbled, but can still be crossed with a spidertron. The abyss tiles can not be filled with landfill. The map also contains more cliffs and rocks. The map is labyrinthine, has narrow choke points and space can be scarce at times. Transporting resources is a big challenge here, rail networks are basically impossible. You'll have to think about where you build which production chain, in order to use space optimally and keep transportation costs low. On the other hand, defending against biters is easier, you usually only have to defend narrow choke points instead of building long walls.

Some movement options are provided via other mods which are installed automatically by this mod:

* __Jump and Swing__ - My reworked grappling hook and jump mod. This is the main way of moving the character around the map.
* __Spidertron Patrols__ - Allows automating resource movement via spidertrons. Main method of getting resources through difficult terrain, but only for short segments or low throughput. Makes a small spidertron variant available at blue science.
* __Lex's Airships__ - Airships that are controlled the same as spidertrons and hence can be automated. Useful for transporting resources over ravines, but need to be fueled via logistic bots.
* __Bulk Teleportation__ - Allows teleportation of resources at a steep electricity cost. Strongly nerfed compared to the original version and only available very late. It costs around 10MW to connect a yellow belt. Basically the replacement for trains in the late game.

Hand-Picked Map Seeds
-----------------------

Here are some hand-picked seeds: 2965077726, 3347003385, 273310745, 2745948135, 2959005515, 699788883, 2030477123. The mod doesn't make sure the game is beatable: in very rare cases, oil might not be reachable or other resources might only be available at a large distance outside the starting area. On the other hand, one can sometimes roll a map with very good terrain near the starting area, so the game wouldn't be too different from a normal playthrough. The hand-picked seeds avoid both these issues.

Compatibility / Optional Mods
-----------------------------

__Airplane Mods:__ The mod comes with Lex's airships mod for logistics, for personal transportation you are intended to use the grappling hook or the airplanes. Aircraft Realism is not suggested; you get stuck when you land on the abyss.

__Map Generation Mods__. Compatible with alien biomes. Possibly not compatible with other mods that change map generation.

__Recipe Mods / Overhaul Mods.__ In theory compatible with many overhauls, but I recommend a short game length. Recommendations

* Production Scrap 2 (install Production Scrap 2 Icon Fix by nIronwolf).
* K2
* AAI industry

For Mod Devs
------------

Instead of using the standard out-of-map tile, this mod uses a copied tile called abyss, this is to make it clear that it can be crossed via movement mods such as the jump, grappling hook or jetpack.
