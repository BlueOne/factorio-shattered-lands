Shattered Lands
===============

The planet you landed on has deep chasms and is full of rocks and cliffs. Travelling and moving resources will be a challenge.

This is only the terrain generation, see Shattered Lands Pack.

General
-------

Part of the Shattered Lands Pack. The pack mod is the officially intended experience, it contains movement options to complement the terrain. Use this mod to create your own experience instead, but be prepared to deal with the consequences of your actions.

When starting a new game, select the Shattered Lands preset!

This mod makes adjustments to the mods in the Shattered Lands Pack if any of them are present: make spiderlings slightly cheaper, make lex's aircrafts available only at yellow science, make bulk teleporters cost more electricity and available later. On by default, can be turned off in mod settings.

Compatibility / Optional Mods
-----------------------------

Read the required mods in the Pack mod and the suggestions made there.

__Airplane Mods:__ With the Aircraft Realism mod you get stuck if you land in the abyss. Maybe install a kill button mod along with it.

__Movement Mods:__ I suggest playing this with some mod that either allows you to cross over small chasms or move slightly faster. I suggest Jump and Swing, my reworked grappling hook mod. Alternatives include an rpg mod, a quick start mod to give yourself exoskeletons, a blink or portal mod, or a jetpack. Or plain old vanilla.
